# bgp-tools-ix-peering-capacity-userscript
This usescript shows total IX peering port capacity for any given network on BGP.tools. I've written it for Tampermonkey (and it could probably be improved upon) so feel free to adapt to other userscript extensions/programs. If you see improvements you could make to the source, feel free to contribute as well.
